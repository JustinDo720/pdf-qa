# Company Handbook Q&A with RAG Workflow

## Objective

Our primary objective is to leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows to create a robust Question & Answer (Q&A) system based on company project documents. This approach enables users to query project documentation and receive accurate, context-aware answers powered by advanced language models.

## Tech Stack

- **LLM (Large Language Model):** For natural language understanding and generation.
- **LangChain:** Framework for building applications with LLMs and integrating external data sources.
- **RAD:** Rapid Application Development tools to accelerate prototyping and deployment.
- **Pinecone:** Vector database for efficient document retrieval and semantic search.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Document Ingestion:** Company project documents (e.g., PDFs) are processed and embedded.
2. **Indexing:** Embeddings are stored in Pinecone for fast similarity search.
3. **Query Handling:** User questions are interpreted by the LLM via LangChain.
4. **Retrieval:** Relevant document sections are fetched from Pinecone.
5. **Answer Generation:** The LLM generates answers using both retrieved context and its own knowledge.

## Getting Started

1. Place your company project documents in the designated folder.
2. Run the ingestion script to index documents in Pinecone.
3. Use the Q&A interface to ask questions about your projects.

## Benefits

- Accurate, context-aware answers
- Scalable to multiple documents and projects
- Easy integration
